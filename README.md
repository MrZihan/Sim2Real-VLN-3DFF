## Sim-to-Real Transfer via 3D Feature Fields for Vision-and-Language Navigation

#### Zihan Wang, Xiangyang Li, Jiahao Yang, Yeqi Liu and Shuqiang Jiang

>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a remote location in 3D environments following the natural language instruction. In this field, the agent is usually trained and evaluated in the navigation simulators, lacking effective approaches for sim-to-real transfer. The VLN agents with only a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments, providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.

The VLN models equipped with a monocular camera have limited navigation success rates of less than 39% on the R2R-CE Val Unseen split. Most VLN models are trained and evaluated in the simulator [6] with the panoramic observation, achieving navigation success rates of over 57%, but hard to deploy on real-world robots."/></div>

### Changlogs
1. [March 1th, 2025] See the improved model [g3D-LF](https://github.com/MrZihan/g3D-LF).
2. [January 15th, 2025] Fixed the BUG `Error: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices` on lines 105-116 and lines 731-743 of `Sim2Real-VLN-3DFF/VLN_3DFF/vlnce_baselines/ss_trainer_ETP.py`.
3. [December 26th, 2024] Some users encountered the error `TypeError: Expected state_dict to be dict-like, got <class 'torch.jit._script.RecursiveScriptModule'>` when loading the CLIP model (ViT-B-16.pt). To resolve this issue, please modify the code for loading the CLIP model from `torch.load('ViT-B-16.pt', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))` to `torch.jit.load('ViT-B-16.pt', map_location=torch.device('cpu')).state_dict()`.
4. **[December 20th, 2024] A bug has been found. There is a significant performance loss when evaluating with multiple GPUs and large batch sizes. Please set both `GPU_NUMBERS` and `NUM_ENVIRONMENTS` to 1 before evaluating the model's performance. This issue is currently being investigated.**
5. [July 12th, 2024] Fixed the bug caused process interruption during performance evaluation.
